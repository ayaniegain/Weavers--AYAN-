## Basic Concepts

1. **What is React JS?**  
   Define React JS, its purpose as a JavaScript library, and its advantages for building user interfaces.

2. **What is JSX?**  
   Explain JSX, its syntax, how it differs from JavaScript, and how it is transpiled to JavaScript.

3. **What is the difference between state and props?**  
   Describe state (mutable, managed within a component) and props (immutable, passed from parent to child). Explain their ownership and management.

4. **What is the Virtual DOM?**  
   Explain the Virtual DOM, its role in optimizing updates, and how it improves performance.

5. **What is reconciliation and the diffing algorithm in React?**  
   Describe the reconciliation process and how the diffing algorithm compares Virtual DOM trees to update the real DOM efficiently.

6. **Why use `key` as `obj.id` instead of index in lists?**  
   Explain why unique `obj.id` keys maintain sequence and improve performance, while index-based keys can cause issues during reordering or updates.

7. **What is React.Fragment?**  
   Describe `React.Fragment`, its use for grouping elements without adding extra DOM nodes, and its shorthand syntax (`<></>`).

## Functional Components and Hooks

8. **How do you define and use `useState` in a functional component?**  
   Explain the `useState` hook, its syntax, and how it differs from normal variables (reactivity, triggers re-renders). Provide an example.

9. **What is `useEffect` and how does it work?**  
   Describe the `useEffect` hook, its purpose for side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions), and its dependency array.

10. **What is `useEffect` cleanup?**  
    Explain the cleanup function in `useEffect`, its role in preventing memory leaks (e.g., clearing timers), and provide an example.

11. **How does the dependency array in `useEffect` work?**  
    Discuss how the dependency array controls when `useEffect` runs, common mistakes (e.g., missing dependencies), and best practices.

12. **How do you render the previous value in `useState`?**  
    Explain how to access the previous state using the functional update form of `setState` (e.g., `setCount(prev => prev + 1)`).

13. **What is `useRef`, and why doesn’t it trigger re-renders?**  
    Describe `useRef`, its use cases (e.g., accessing DOM elements, persisting values), and why it avoids re-rendering.

14. **What is `useReducer`, and how does it work?**  
    Explain `useReducer`, including the reducer function, initial state, state and action objects, and dispatching actions with type and payload.

15. **What are custom hooks?**  
    Define custom hooks, how to create them, and provide an example (e.g., a hook for fetching data).

## Component Communication and Data Flow

16. **How do you pass props in React?**  
    Explain how props are passed from parent to child components, including examples of passing strings, objects, and functions.

17. **What is props drilling, and how can it be avoided?**  
    Describe props drilling and solutions like `useContext`, Redux, or Zustand to manage state globally.

18. **How do you pass data from a child to a parent component?**  
    Explain how to pass data using callback functions passed as props, with an example.

19. **What is `useContext`, and how does it work?**  
    Describe the `useContext` hook, how to create a context, use a `Provider`, and consume context in components.

20. **How do you pass children in React components?**  
    Explain the `children` prop, how it is used to render nested content, and provide examples (e.g., wrapper components).

## Forms and Inputs

21. **What are controlled components in React forms?**  
    Explain controlled components, how form values are managed with state, and provide an example of a controlled input.

22. **How do you handle multiple inputs dynamically in a form?**  
    Describe how to manage multiple inputs using a single state object and dynamic updates (e.g., using `name` attributes).

23. **What are the different types of forms in React?**  
    Compare controlled and uncontrolled forms, their use cases, and when to use `useRef` for uncontrolled inputs.

## Data Fetching and Rendering

24. **How do you fetch data from a URL in React?**  
    Explain how to fetch data using `fetch` or `axios` in `useEffect`, including handling loading, success, and error states.

25. **How do you render multiple UI elements based on state?**  
    Describe conditional rendering based on state (e.g., loading spinners, error messages, or data lists).

## Class Components

26. **What are React class components?**  
    Explain class components, their syntax, and how they differ from functional components.

27. **What are the lifecycle methods in class-based components?**  
    Describe key lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.) and their use cases.

## Advanced Topics

28. **What is prop-types in React?**  
    Explain the `prop-types` library, its role in type-checking props, and how to use it.

29. **What are nullish coalescing and optional chaining in JavaScript?**  
    Describe the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) and optional chaining (`?.`), and their use in React for safe property access.

## Additional Questions

30. **What are the benefits of using React Hooks over class components?**  
    Discuss advantages like simpler syntax, reusability, and avoiding complex lifecycle methods.

31. **How do you optimize performance in a React application?**  
    Explain techniques like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, lazy loading, and code splitting.

32. **What is the role of `React.StrictMode`?**  
    Describe `React.StrictMode`, its purpose in identifying unsafe practices, and its behavior in development.

33. **How do you handle errors in React applications?**  
    Explain error boundaries, their implementation, and their role in catching rendering errors.

34. **What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?**  
    Compare `useMemo` (memoizing values) and `useCallback` (memoizing functions), including their use cases.

35. **How does React handle event handling differently from vanilla JavaScript?**  
    Discuss React’s synthetic events, event delegation, and differences from native JavaScript events.

36. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React?**  
    Explain SSR, its benefits (e.g., SEO, faster initial load), and frameworks like Next.js.

37. **What is the significance of keys in React lists?**  
    Discuss the role of keys in helping React identify elements during reconciliation, beyond `obj.id` vs. index.

38. **How do you manage global state in a React application?**  
    Compare approaches like `useContext`, Redux, Zustand, and Recoil for global state management.

39. **What is the purpose of `useLayoutEffect`?**  
    Explain `useLayoutEffect`, its differences from `useEffect`, and when to use it (e.g., DOM measurements).

40. **What are React Portals?**  
    Describe React Portals, their use for rendering components outside the parent DOM hierarchy, and provide an example (e.g., modals).
